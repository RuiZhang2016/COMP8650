\subsection{Prob1.}
If $det(A) = 0$, then $det(A^T) = 0$, therefore $det(A) = det(A^T)$.\\
If $det(A) \neq 0$, then matrix has inverse. So $A$ is a full rank matrix. Since every full rank matrix can be written as a product of elementary matrices:
$$
R_1\dots R_tI_nC_1\dots C_s
$$
where $R_i$ are row elementary matrices and $C_i$ are column elementary matrices. We know that for all elementary matrices, $det(E) = det(E^T)$ (because column expansion or row expansion of $det$ doesn't change the value) and $(A_1\dots A_n)^T = A_n^T\dots A_1^T$. Therefore,
